Important notes taken from the various steps of the attack:

get_candidates:
- After running the script that is responsible for finding the unique entries in the data, out of 1000 rows 929 came out 
unique. 
- This important because it shows how unique is the dataset, and how vulnerable it probably will be to a linkage attack.
- The data might be EXTREMLY vulnerable.

link_candidates:
- After running the script that is responsible for linking users from the work_data into the unique users found in the 
med_data that was de-identified, 630 users were successfully linked ou of 1000.
- This shows how EXTREMLY vulnerable the data is even if it gets re-identified.
- Now if it checks with the orignal data, "heads will roll".
